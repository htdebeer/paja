Paja is a simple JavaScript wrapper around [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), the
great multi-format document converter. Paja is inspired by
[Paru](https://heerdebeer.org/Software/markdown/paru/), a
[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) wrapper for pandoc that I wrote earlier.
Like Paru, Paja support automating the use of pandoc. Paja is [free
software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html);
Paja is licenced under the [GNU General Public Licence version
3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html). Get the code at
[https://github.com/htdebeer/paja]((https://github.com/htdebeer/paja).

The current version of Paja is *0.0.0*, which is a first alpha version.

See [Paja's webpage](https://heerdebeer.org/Software/markdown/paja/) for more
detailed documentation. Below follows a very brief excerpt of that
documentation

# Installation

Because Paja is a wrapper around pandoc, pandoc obviously is a requirement for
Paja. Install Paja with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

    npm install -g paja

# Usage
